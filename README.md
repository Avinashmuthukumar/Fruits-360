# Fruits-360

•	Main objective is to classify between qualities of vegetable and fruits by training a neural network with large amount of image dataset of good and rotten vegetables and fruits. After training when a vegetable or fruit is given to network it should classify it according to its quality. Grading and classification is based on obtained feature values from detected image.
•	Proposed method is used to increase the accuracy of the vegetable quality detection by classification by using convolutional neural network algorithm of deep learning which based on artificial neural network (ANN).
•	Thanks to Mr.Horea Muresan and Mr.Mihail Oltean who have introduced new high-quality dataset of images containing fruits and also present the results of some numerical experiment for training a neural network to detect fruits.
